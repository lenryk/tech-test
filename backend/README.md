## Backend

The `/backend` folder contains the Express backend that should be run first.

To run the backend run `npm run start` for the normal production build or `npm run start:dev` for the dev mode with nodemon and automatic reloading on file changes.

The default port for the backend is `8000` and can be accessed on http://localhost:8000 once launched.

There are also tests set up that can be run using `npm run test`
