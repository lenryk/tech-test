## Frontend

The `/frontend` folder contains the React frontend that should be run after the backend has started.

To run the frontend, in the folder run `npm run start`

The default port for the frontend is `3000` and can be accessed on http://localhost:3000 once launched.

There are also tests set up that can be run using `npm run test`
